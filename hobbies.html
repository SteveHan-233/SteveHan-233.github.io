            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>My passion for music has driven me to improve my musical abilities so that I can turn my musical ideas into tangible
                creations.
                <br>
                <br> The guitar is my primary instrument, which I have played for 8 years; and currently I am taking lessons
                to improve my music theory on the guitar while continuing to practice techniques every day.

            <p>I have taught myself photography and worked as a photographer for a local organization.</p>
            <p class="darker">For me, the art of photography is not only about the perfect composition and techniques - it is also about the
                experience, the simple act of traveling and preserving the moments using a camera; and it is about the passion,
                the love for the world that drives so many artists to capture its beauty. </p>

            <p>I love expressing myself using my camera and editing software. The fact that I can tell a story in so many different
                styles gives me a world of freedom for my creativity to run wild. </p>
            <p class="darker">The screen is the canvas, the camera the brush; and my mind is the sole creator of this splendid artwork. </p>
