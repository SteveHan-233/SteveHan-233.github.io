                    social skills by communicating with different customers, and I became more mature at managing my relationship

                <p>In our robotics team, I was the main engineer of our robot that won a regional competition. I designed
                    and constructed many components of the robot, and I wrote the program that allows us to control them
                    remotely. During the construction of the robot, I learned to solve problems using the engineering process
                    and to document the process on the engineering notebook, which are also beneficial to my programming
                    endeavors. </p>
